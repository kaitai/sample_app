== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. Here it does the same thing.

This is the sample application from the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

It is cool to see how everyone explains RoR differently.

* Ruby 4.0.5
